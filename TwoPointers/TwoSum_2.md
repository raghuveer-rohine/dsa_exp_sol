Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers index1 and index2, each incremented by one, as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

```java
    public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
            map.put(numbers[i], i);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
            int n = target - numbers[i];
            if (map.containsKey(n)) {
                return new int[] {i + 1, map.get(n) + 1};
            }
        }

        return new int[] {};
    }
```
